- Downloading the latest version of each tool.
- Executing the tool immediately after download.
- Cleaning up by deleting the downloaded files once theyâ€™re no longer needed.

2. **Navigate to the Script**: Open PowerShell and navigate to the folder containing the scripts.

3. **Run the Script**: Execute the desired script by running:

4. **Optional - Create Shortcuts**: Follow the instructions at the end of each script to create shortcuts for easy access in the future.
