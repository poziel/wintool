irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/poziel/wintool/refs/heads/master/apps/<scriptname>.ps1 | iex
```

Replace `<scriptname>` with one of the available scripts listed above.  
Example for running CPU-Z:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/poziel/wintool/refs/heads/master/apps/cpuz.ps1 | iex
```

By default:
