## ⚙ How to Use (Global Instructions)

You can execute any WinTool script directly from the repository without downloading the entire repo, using the following PowerShell command:

Replace `<scriptname>` with one of the available scripts listed above.  
Example for running CPU-Z:

```powershell
irm https://wintool.poziel.dev/cpuz | iex
```

By default:
- The script will **download** the latest portable version of the tool
