# CPU-Z is a lightweight system profiling tool that provides detailed information on the CPU, 
# motherboard, memory, and other hardware components of a Windows system.

# Key Features:
# - Displays detailed CPU information, including core architecture, clock speed, cache levels, and more.
# - Shows motherboard specifications, such as model, chipset, and BIOS version.
# - Provides memory module details, including type, size, and speed.
# - Includes real-time monitoring of CPU core frequencies and voltage.
# - Portable and easy to use for quick system diagnostics and hardware identification.

# Usage Example:
# - Running CPU-Z gives users a comprehensive view of CPU and system specs:
#   CPU-Z -ShowCPUInfo
# - Here, '-ShowCPUInfo' displays detailed processor information for quick review.

# Typical Workflow:
# 1. CPU-Z scans and displays hardware specifications for the CPU, motherboard, memory, and graphics.
# 2. Users can navigate tabs to view detailed component information and monitor live CPU stats.
# 3. Results can be used for system analysis, upgrade planning, or troubleshooting hardware issues.

# CPU-Z is ideal for users looking to understand their hardware components in detail 
# or monitor CPU behavior for diagnostics and performance assessment.
