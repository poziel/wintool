# CrystalDiskInfo is a disk health monitoring tool that provides detailed information about 
# storage drives, including temperature, health status, and S.M.A.R.T. (Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology) attributes.

# Key Features:
# - Monitors and displays health status, temperature, and detailed S.M.A.R.T. information for HDDs and SSDs.
# - Provides real-time alerts for potential drive issues to help prevent data loss.
# - Includes power-on hours, reallocated sector count, and other metrics for in-depth drive analysis.
# - Supports customizable alert thresholds for specific attributes.
# - Portable and easy to use, making it accessible for quick diagnostics.

# Usage Example:
# - Running CrystalDiskInfo provides users with real-time health and performance metrics for their storage devices:
#   CrystalDiskInfo -MonitorHealth -AlertThreshold 80
# - Here, '-MonitorHealth' displays health data, and '-AlertThreshold 80' sets an alert at 80% of the defined thresholds.

# Typical Workflow:
# 1. CrystalDiskInfo scans connected storage drives and displays health, temperature, and S.M.A.R.T. attributes.
# 2. Users review health indicators and configure alerts for specific thresholds if needed.
# 3. Regular monitoring helps detect early signs of drive failure, enabling timely action to prevent data loss.

# CrystalDiskInfo is ideal for users who want to monitor the health and performance of their storage drives 
# and receive alerts about potential issues.
