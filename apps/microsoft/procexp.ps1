# Process Explorer by Microsoft is an advanced task manager utility that provides in-depth insight 
# into active processes and system resource usage, allowing users to monitor, analyze, and manage system performance.

# Key Features:
# - Displays a hierarchical view of all running processes, with detailed information on resource consumption.
# - Allows users to view specific process attributes, including CPU, memory, and I/O usage, as well as active threads and handles.
# - Supports real-time monitoring and identification of resource-intensive processes.
# - Features a powerful search tool to locate which processes are using specific files or DLLs.
# - Includes process killing and suspension options for direct control over unwanted or problematic processes.

# Usage Example:
# - Running Process Explorer offers an interface to monitor and manage system processes effectively:
#   ProcessExplorer -MonitorCPU -ViewDetails
# - Here, '-MonitorCPU' shows CPU usage per process, and '-ViewDetails' reveals detailed information on each process.

# Typical Workflow:
# 1. Process Explorer lists all running processes with a tree view showing parent-child relationships.
# 2. Users can click on processes to view extensive details or suspend/kill them if needed.
# 3. Real-time metrics help in identifying performance bottlenecks or troubleshooting specific system issues.

# Process Explorer is a go-to tool for users and IT professionals needing deeper insight into system activity, 
# offering more control and detail than the standard Windows Task Manager.
