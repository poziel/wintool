# Process Monitor by Microsoft is a real-time monitoring tool that captures detailed events related to file system, 
# registry, and process activity, enabling users to track down and troubleshoot complex system issues.

# Key Features:
# - Monitors and logs file system, registry, network, and process events in real time.
# - Provides filtering options to isolate specific types of events or actions, streamlining troubleshooting.
# - Includes event detail views, showing process information, time stamps, and action results for each event.
# - Allows users to save and export captured data for deeper analysis or future reference.
# - Offers stack trace capture to help diagnose issues at the code or function call level.

# Usage Example:
# - Running Process Monitor initiates real-time event logging, which can be filtered for specific actions:
#   ProcessMonitor -Filter "Registry" -SaveLog "C:\Logs\RegistryMonitor.pml"
# - Here, '-Filter "Registry"' limits output to registry events, and '-SaveLog' exports results for later review.

# Typical Workflow:
# 1. Process Monitor begins logging all specified system events and provides live updates in the interface.
# 2. The user applies filters to focus on relevant event types (e.g., registry access).
# 3. Captured events are reviewed in detail or exported for further analysis, enabling precise troubleshooting.

# Process Monitor is ideal for IT professionals and power users who need granular visibility into 
# system behavior, especially for diagnosing hard-to-find issues in applications or system configurations.
