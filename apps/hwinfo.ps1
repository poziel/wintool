# HWiNFO is a comprehensive hardware information and diagnostic tool that provides in-depth system 
# information, sensor monitoring, and reporting for Windows systems.

# Key Features:
# - Displays detailed information on system components, including CPU, GPU, memory, and storage.
# - Provides real-time sensor monitoring for temperatures, voltages, and fan speeds.
# - Includes customizable reports for system diagnostics and health checks.
# - Allows users to set alerts and notifications based on sensor thresholds.
# - Supports extensive logging options, enabling users to track performance over time.

# Usage Example:
# - Running HWiNFO allows users to view live hardware stats and save detailed reports:
#   HWiNFO -MonitorSensors -CreateReport
# - Here, '-MonitorSensors' enables live monitoring, while '-CreateReport' generates a full hardware report.

# Typical Workflow:
# 1. HWiNFO scans the system and displays a complete overview of all hardware components.
# 2. Users can monitor real-time data from system sensors or run diagnostics.
# 3. Reports are generated as needed, with options for alerts and historical logging.

# HWiNFO is ideal for users who want detailed visibility into their hardwareâ€™s performance and status, 
# making it an essential tool for enthusiasts and professionals.
