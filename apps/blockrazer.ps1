# Block Razer Utility Script by Chris Titus Tech is a lightweight PowerShell tool to disable the 
# automatic launch of Razer Synapse software and related services on Windows, minimizing background resource usage.

# Key Features:
# - Disables startup entries for Razer Synapse to prevent it from auto-launching.
# - Stops and disables Razer services running in the background, freeing up system resources.
# - Reversible, allowing users to re-enable Razer services if needed.

# Usage Example:
# - Running the script in a PowerShell terminal immediately halts Razer services:
#   BlockRazerUtility -Disable
# - Using '-Disable' stops and disables all relevant Razer services on startup.

# Typical Workflow:
# 1. The script identifies and disables startup entries and running Razer services.
# 2. Razer software no longer launches on system startup, reducing background processes.

# Block Razer Utility is ideal for users wanting to optimize system performance by preventing 
# unnecessary Razer software from running in the background.
