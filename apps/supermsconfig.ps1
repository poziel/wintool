# SuperMSConfig by Builtbybel is an advanced system configuration tool for Windows that extends the 
# functionality of the classic MSConfig utility, offering more control over startup, services, and system settings.

# Key Features:
# - Provides in-depth management options for startup programs and background services.
# - Allows users to disable, enable, or delay startup items to optimize boot time.
# - Includes tools for managing Windows services with detailed descriptions and recommendations.
# - Offers control over scheduled tasks and other system settings for enhanced performance.
# - Supports exporting and importing configurations for easy system setup and recovery.

# Usage Example:
# - Running SuperMSConfig offers a comprehensive view of startup items and services for customization:
#   SuperMSConfig -ManageStartup -OptimizeBoot
# - Here, '-ManageStartup' enables startup item control, and '-OptimizeBoot' adjusts settings to improve boot performance.

# Typical Workflow:
# 1. SuperMSConfig scans and lists all startup items, services, and scheduled tasks.
# 2. Users manage individual items to enable, disable, or delay based on system requirements.
# 3. Configuration changes are applied, optimizing system performance and startup efficiency.

# SuperMSConfig by Builtbybel is ideal for power users who want enhanced control over their Windows startup 
# and services beyond the basic MSConfig options.
